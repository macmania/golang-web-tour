This project serves as an introduction golang tour on how to set up a very simple restful web API from scratch using the net/http package. 
      - main.go
      
For more 'mature' examples, check out mainweb.go as an introduction on how to set up web API using the gorilla/mux web framework for route handling. 

I give credit to Ryanne Dolan for the starter kit :)
